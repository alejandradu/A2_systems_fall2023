What authorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

The course's lectures.

The course's precepts.

The course's textbooks.

The man pages on the armlab cluster.

The course's current staff members outside of class time through 
office hours.

Current Intro Lab TAs through visits to the Intro COS Lab

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was very helpful to understand pointers and see how they work
better in some cases than arrays.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

n/a

What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

stra.c: line 124: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

The area is nested, but I don't think it affects the code negatively.
Each level of the nest has only one statement, and
it is not possible to refactor while keeping the logic that
worked best. In fact, I introduced the helper function
Str_scan_match to avoid confusing nesting, mindful of 
good programming style.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

strp.c: line 143: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

Same reasoning as above. 

The area is nested, but I don't think it affects the code negatively.

What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

Yes. Each function could get the length of the destination char array
and the source char array (to copy or concat), anc call (in
pseudocode):

assert(destination length >= destination length + source length)

then the function can handle each case. If the destination length
is not enough, it might raise a warning/error and not copy/concat
or only do so partially, or allocate extra memory somehow.
